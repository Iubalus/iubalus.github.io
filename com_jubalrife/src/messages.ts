                "My name is Jubal Rife. I'm a Software developer with over nine years of experience working in a small but exceptional team to develop and maintain a full stack application and suite of services including many inter-company service solutions.",
                "I have worked for the same company for the majority of my career. Over the course of this work I have advanced from a junior developer to a staff engineer position. I have worked with many different technologies and have a wide set of responsibilities including dev-ops, development, mentorship, architecture design, and project management.",
                "I am a lifelong learner and toolbuilder. I seek out technologies, ideas, and practices that I am not familiar with to improve my knowledge and skills. I am always working towards greater personal effectiveness, mentorship, and leadership. While being employed by the same company for a long period of time has many benefits, it can lead to knowledge blind-spots, reliance on in-house tooling, and habitual decision making (company status-quo). I hope to resist these natural forces by staying curious, staying aware, and learning new things through study and practice.",
                "I may not (or in some cases cannot) share all of my learning experiences on this site, but I plan to use this as one of my tools for both learning and sharing what I have learned.",
                "Thanks for visiting!"
