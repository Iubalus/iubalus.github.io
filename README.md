## Introduction

This is my Github Pages site accessible at
 - https://jubalrife.net
 - http://jubalrife.com
 - https://iubalus.github.io

> I am using this site as a learning exercise and experimental playground.
> If you are here to use this as an example, please be cautious about what practices or examples you decide to reuse.

## History
- The site was created using HTML, javascript, and css and configured to deploy as a Github pages site.
- Integrated custom domain for the site (configured CNAME)
- JQuery was added
- sass was added
- The site was partially converted to use Vite (Vue/Typescript)
- The site was simplified back to HTML, javascript, and css (some JQuery remains)

It has been an enjoyable experiment writing and re-writing the site to try different tools and learn more about this space.
