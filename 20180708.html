        <p>
            An important and ever present part in the life of a software developer is dealing with mistakes. How we
            respond to our mistakes and the mistakes of others is important. Properly responding to mistakes can
            create
            value that will otherwise go to waste. Improperly responding to mistakes can result in a hostile
            environment
            that discourages openness and progress.
        </p>
        <p>There is a reasonable set of actions that can be taken in the face of a mistake</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the mistake known</li>
            <li>Be Kind to the one who made the mistake</li>
            <li>Correct the mistake Quickly</li>
            <li>Attempt to prevent the mistake in the future</li>
            <li>Reset before continuing</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The goal of these actions is to reduce harm to the team, the product, and the users while extracting as
            much
            value from a mistake as is possible.
        </p>
        <h4>1 Make the Mistake known</h4>
        <p>
            Mistakes vary wildly in severity from simple mistakes that may result in a loss of face or mild
            annoyance to
            mistakes which may be damaging to the team as a whole or the core product experience. Regardless of the
            severity of the mistake, it is important to share what has happened with someone else. There are
            multiple
            reasons behind doing this. When a problem shared is a problem that is less likely to happen again.
            Awareness
            is one of the most powerful tools against mistakes. Another reason is that a solution will likely be
            more
            quickly created with more minds on the task; indeed, sharing may make an otherwise unfixable mistake
            fixable. If a mistake is invisible, there may be a temptation to hide it. This would be unprofessional
            and
            should be avoided. A hidden mistake is a trap for yourself and others. Sharing mistakes is the
            professional
            thing to do.
        </p>
        <h4>2 Be Kind to the one who made the mistake</h4>
        <p>
            For a team to function, learn, and grow, there must be a safe environment for the passage of
            information.
            All failures are opportunities for growth. It will damage the team’s ability to learn and grow to
            belittle
            people for making mistakes: This includes yourself. Treat mistakes as a tool for moving the team
            forwards
            rather than a tool for beating yourself or others about the head. If you work in an environment which is
            not
            comfortable sharing mistakes either due to fear of ridicule or punishment, it is more likely that the
            team
            will suffer when a mistake that cannot be corrected alone is made.
        </p>
        <h4>3 Correct the Mistake Quickly</h4>
        <p>
            If a mistake can be corrected quickly, it should be corrected quickly. This will reduce the total damage
            done by the mistake. If you can reduce the damage a mistake has caused, then you can maximize the
            benefits
            of having made a mistake without paying as much of a price.
        </p>
        <h4>4 Attempt to Prevent the mistake in the future</h4>
        <p>Code-based mistakes are generally prevented from happening again by creating automated tests to verify
            that a
            behavior is doing the correct thing. I would recommend this for most code problems. Not all problems can
            be
            fixed
            with an automated solution; indeed, some problems have nothing to do with code whatsoever. For such
            problems, it is
            important to be creative. If a solution is impossible within the current domain, expand the domain.
            Perhaps
            the
            problem can be fixed with convention or procedure farther out, or perhaps training and increased
            awareness.
            If there
            is no prevention solution, then perhaps a contingency plan could be implemented. Recognize the failure
            and
            devise a
            way to quickly recover.</p>
        <p>By creating a way to prevent or quickly respond to a mistake, as a team you gain resilience. While the
            burden
            of a
            mistake rests on the one who made the mistake, the burden of the response to a mistake rests entirely on
            the
            team.
            If someone in the team deleted half of the database, you’d better have a backup of the database. If you
            don’t, then
            you’d better have a backup of the database next time someone deletes half of the database.</p>
        <h4>5 Reset Before Continuing</h4>
        <p>This is a step that is easily missed because it is not required for you to continue functioning.
            Depending on
            the
            stress level of the experience you just had, and the response of other team members to a mistake, you
            may be
            in a
            fight-or-flight response mode. Fight-or-flight is a state which is not well suited to critically solving
            abstract
            problems; it is a state which is suited to physically responding to a threat. We are more likely to
            clash
            with team
            members or make additional mistakes when in this state. If it is possible, it is a good idea to take
            some
            time to
            reset yourself before returning to work after dealing with a stressful situation. Do some light exercise
            or
            have a
            snack. Take a walk or just move away from your computer and sit peacefully for a bit. When your body has
            returned to
            a normal state, then you can return to work. In this way you will avoid a snowballing of mistakes. This
            is
            especially important if the mistake occurred during a stressful operation which must still be completed.
            Unfortunately some mistakes are urgent enough that they do not allow us to rest before they are
            completed.
            For these
            mistakes, it is especially important to have people you can trust and rely on. With more eyes on the
            problem, you
            can alleviate some of the problems caused by being flustered.</p>

        <p>Following these guidelines will encourage a safe environment for quickly and effectively responding to
            mistakes.
            Ideally, the frequency of mistakes will be reduced by preventive mechanisms, the severity of
            un-preventable
            mistakes
            will be reduced by contingency plans, and the team will build a healthy attitude to sharing
            responsibility.</p>
