				<h1>Hello World!</h1>
				<p>My name is Jubal Rife. I'm a Software developer with over <span id="exp-years">11</span> years of experience working in a
					small but exceptional team to develop and maintain a full stack application and suite of
					services including many inter-company service solutions.</p>
				<p>I have worked for the same company for the majority of my career. Over the course of this work I
					have advanced from a junior developer to a staff engineer position. I have worked with many
					different technologies and have a wide set of responsibilities including dev-ops, development,
					mentorship, architecture design, and project management.</p>
				<p>I am a lifelong learner and toolbuilder. I seek out technologies, ideas, and practices that I am
					not familiar with to improve my knowledge and skills. I am always working towards greater
					personal effectiveness, mentorship, and leadership. While being employed by the same company for
					a long period of time has many benefits, it can lead to knowledge blind-spots, reliance on
					in-house tooling, and habitual decision making (company status-quo). I hope to resist these
					natural forces by staying curious, staying aware, and learning new things through study and
					practice.</p>
				<p>I may not (or in some cases cannot) share all of my learning experiences on this site, but I plan
					to use this as one of my tools for both learning and sharing what I have learned.</p>
				<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
